This project provides a fully automated solution for managing and participating in auctions on the Salasar Auction platform using Python and Selenium WebDriver. It is designed to simulate the complete lifecycle of an auction, covering both the Admin and Bidder workflows. On the admin side, the script automates login, navigation through the auction dashboard, and the creation of a new auction by copying details from a backdated auction. It fills in all necessary auction details, including the date, start and end times, location, and catalogue ID, handling complex UI elements such as iframes and Select2 dropdowns. Once the auction details are completed, the script publishes the auction, fetches the relevant lots, and prepares the auction for bidder participation. The automation also includes steps to fetch auction results after bids have been placed, ensuring that the workflow can be validated end-to-end.

On the bidder side, the automation logs in as a bidder, navigates to the “Today’s Auction” section, and handles dynamic elements such as popups and modal dialogs. It interacts with the auction interface to accept terms and conditions, click the “Bid Now” button, and submit multiple bids sequentially. The script uses explicit waits to ensure that elements are interactable before performing actions, and it leverages ActionChains to handle keyboard shortcuts for copying and pasting auction IDs. Iframes and dynamically generated UI components are managed carefully to avoid failures, making the automation robust against complex web layouts.

Error handling is built into critical steps of the script, with automatic screenshots captured whenever interactions fail, including issues with terms acceptance, bid submission, or fetching auction results. ChromeDriver is managed using webdriver-manager, eliminating the need for manual setup. While the script uses a few hardcoded delays (time.sleep) for UI stabilization, explicit waits are primarily used to ensure reliability.

This project is ideal for internal testing, QA validation, or demonstration purposes and is not intended for live production bidding. Credentials are currently stored in the script, so for production use, it is recommended to secure them using environment variables or a configuration file. Future improvements could include adopting a Page Object Model structure, replacing static delays with fully dynamic waits, implementing logging instead of print statements, and adding CI/CD pipeline support for automated regression testing.
