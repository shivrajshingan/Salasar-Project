This project automates the complete end-to-end auction workflow of the Salasar Auction platform using Python and Selenium WebDriver. The script handles both Admin and Bidder operations in a single flow, starting from admin login, copying a backdated auction, filling auction details such as date, time, and location, publishing the auction, fetching lots, and later fetching auction results. On the bidder side, it automates bidder login, navigation to today’s auctions, popup handling, accepting terms and conditions, and placing multiple bids successfully. The automation uses explicit waits, ActionChains, iframe handling, and Select2 interactions to reliably work with a dynamic web UI. ChromeDriver is managed automatically using webdriver-manager, eliminating manual driver setup. The script also includes basic error handling and captures screenshots when critical steps fail, making debugging easier. This project is intended for internal testing and QA validation of auction workflows and assumes a stable UI structure of the Salasar Auction platform.
